                    <h2>Begin At The End</h2>
                    <p>One thing you are always asked to do when starting any sort of diet or exercise program is to start at the end. What is your end goal? How much weight do you want to lose? When do you want to have achieved your end goal? They're all the same!</p>
                    <p>Maybe I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective here, or maybe this will make perfect sense to you too, this is what I think. As humans, our brains are overloaded day after day with information.</p>

                <div class="collapse mt-3" id="hidden">
                    <h3>Want to know what I think?</h3>
                    <p>We wake up in the morning and immediately start to make plans, without even realising that we're doing it. Before I even get out of bed, I have already decided what time I need to leave the house, what I need to do throughout the day, and even what I'll be making for tea!'</p>
                    <p>I'll walk the kids to school and see endless signs telling me what I need to buy, tempting me with adverts for fast food and even which toothpaste I should use! I'll get home and turn the radio on to listen to adverts for local businesses, then at night I'll watch some TV and see yet more adverts. All of this time, I'm seeing colours and shapes, I'm smelling good smells and bad smells, I'm hearing sound from the radio or the TV. Anyway, the point is that we are surrounded by stimuli, living in a world that seems to exist to overload us to the point of distraction, and sometimes we just need to stop.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, one of the biggest problems we face when it comes to weightloss is that we start our journey focusing on the end goal. I don't set out on a journey thinking about directions for a trip I'll be making next week! I want to live in the now. So, instead of focusing on the long goal, lets think about now.</p>
                    <p>We need to switch out the questions, so instead of how much weight do you want to lose, think about how you think you can adapt your diet or exercise to begin losing weight. Instead of thinking about the end goal, lets just think about now. This journey is not easy, but it isn't a race. We will get there one step at a time, in managable steps, but most importantly, we won't be dieting, we will simply be learning a new way to live.</p>

                    <h2>Are you a prisoner too?</h2>
                    <p>Every day, billions of people are being conned, tricked, bamboozled, by food. The word 'food' is powerful, and can have devastating effects on some people. However, food is not just a word. It is our fuel - petrol for the body. Our food can control us without us even realising that it IS controlling us. Let me give you an example... </p>
                    <p>My whole life I have followed the rules inflicted on me by food. I wake up in the morning and have breakfast. Whilst eating my breakfast I am deciding what I'll have for my dinner...

                    <h3>My Life in a Nutshell</h3>
                    <p>Before I've had my dinner I'm wondering whether I can fit in a chocolate bar, or whether I should have my dinner early. I've had my dinner and planned what I'm having for tea. I'm thinking about what I need to pick up from the shop on my way home. How long it will take to prep and cook. How much I need to make based on how many I'm cooking for. All this thinking makes me feel peckish so I have a packet of crisps before tea.After I've had my tea I have dessert. Dessert seems to last all night with a bit of chocolate, a few sweets, a bowl of cereal. Before I know it, it's bed time. I go to bed feeling full, maybe a little too full. I tell myself I will eat better tomorrow. I wake up tomorrow, and have breakfast, and so begins the story of my day.</p>
                    <p>If you can relate to this pattern then, I'm sorry to say, that you are an inmate, a fellow prisoner of food. This pattern of food, food, food, sleep, food, food, food, sleep, goes on and on, and is the reason that I decided to train as a nutritionist.'</p>
                    <p>One of the problems I hear most often is about how food packaging can be misleading. What sounds like 'Innocent' (see what I did there!) food, is actually full of sugar, fat, carbs and so on. I've had many clients who thought they were doing well because they ate 'No Fat' or 'Low Fat' foods, but they failed to notice that this claim of 'Fat Free' is simply a process which removes fat and replaces it with sugar.</p>
